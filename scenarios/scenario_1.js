/*
## SITUATION
You got lucky, and your site became famous, leading to a surge in traffic.

The number of simultaneous users increased from 5 to 10,000.

Traffic spiked from a few requests per second to thousands of requests per second.

## REQUIREMENTS
We donâ€™t have the resources to scale up the servers, so we have to think something else.

1. P95 for http_req_duration_customers should be under 300ms.
2. http_reqs ~500/s

## NOTES
* Database queries take around 50ms to complete and can't be optimized.
* The catalog includes complex logic that takes around 10ms to complete, which blocks the thread. We have to live with it.
